# extouchtriangle/dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for extouchtriangle.
These are mainly used for syncing files between computers,
(and sometimes different VMs within the same computer)
but others can also see this to see what possible configuration options
are for software that I use.

This repo was generated using chezmoi.

## Notable files

- [`dot_config/nvim/after/queries/latex/highlights.scm`](https://github.com/extouchtriangle/dotfiles/tree/main/dot_config/nvim/after/queries/latex/highlights.scm): LaTeX treesitter concealer that actually works

## Fun random fact

This repo is bigger than all my other ones combined.
In fact, I had
to omit this repo in my "Most Used Languages" display
for my profile.

To see why, here is what would have happened if I
had not omitted this repo:
<a href="https://github.com/extouchtriangle?tab=repositories">
<img height=200 align="center" src="https://extouchtriangle-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=extouchtriangle&theme=tokyonight&show_icons=true&border_color=43c2b2&layout=donut" />
</a>

Meanwhile, my profile says (without this repo):
<a href="https://github.com/extouchtriangle?tab=repositories">
<img height=200 align="center" src="https://extouchtriangle-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=extouchtriangle&theme=tokyonight&show_icons=true&border_color=43c2b2&layout=donut&exclude_repo=dotfiles" />
</a>
