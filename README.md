# extouchtriangle/dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for extouchtriangle.
These are mainly used for syncing files between computers,
(and sometimes different VMs within the same computer)
but others can also see this to see what possible configuration options
are for software that I use.

This repo was generated using chezmoi.
